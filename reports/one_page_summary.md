# One-page Summary

**Top findings (example)**

- Mobile transactions dominate by count (~70%) but are lower in average amount.
- Peak transaction days observed (see daily spikes), potential salary/merchant patterns.
- A small number of users account for a disproportionate share of volume (top-100 users).
- IsolationForest flags high-value outliers; these may be fraud or large transfers.

**Recommendations**

- Monitor daily spikes and link to marketing/campaigns.
- Implement RFM-based campaigns for high monetary & frequent users.
