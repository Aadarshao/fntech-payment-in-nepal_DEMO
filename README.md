## About
Nepal is rapidly moving into the digital payments era. As of mid‑January 2025, mobile banking penetration soared to **89%**, with **26.5 million mobile banking accounts**, alongside **25.8 million wallet accounts** and **13.4 million debit card accounts**. Mobile banking captures over **70% of transactions by count** but only about **6.6% of total transaction value**—highlighting frequent low‑value payments in Nepal's digital ecosystem.

This project explores a synthetic Nepal‑calibrated payments dataset (3 months, 20,000 rows). It demonstrates EDA, RFM segmentation, anomaly detection, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard.
